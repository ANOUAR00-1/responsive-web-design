# Responsive Web Design Project

This repository contains a responsive web design project built with HTML5 and CSS3. It demonstrates various layout techniques and responsive behaviors for different screen sizes, created as part of an educational course.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main pages:

1.  **Main Landing Page (`index.html`)**: A comprehensive landing page featuring:
    *   A responsive header with navigation links.
    *   A hero section with imagery and call-to-action buttons.
    *   Informational sections with card layouts.
    *   A statistical/counter section.
    *   A footer with social media links and contact info.

2.  **Support/Secondary Page (`travail support/support.html`)**: A separate page demonstrating different layout patterns, including:
    *   A distinct header style.
    *   Article layouts with text wrapping.
    *   Image galleries.
    *   Gradient text effects.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes (mobile vs. desktop) using CSS Media Queries (breakpoints at 600px and 767px).
*   **Flexbox Layout**: Extensive use of CSS Flexbox for alignment and distribution of elements.
*   **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects on buttons, links, and images (scaling, color changes).
*   **Typography & Icons**: Integration of Google Fonts and Material Icons/Symbols.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure.
*   **CSS3**: Styling, animations, gradients, and responsive design rules.
